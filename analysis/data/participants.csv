P1,tom-first,True,M,6.0,6,6.0,4,2,1,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Check if my logic is correct, evaluating code structure. I use LLMs sometimes for these tasks",I like it is able to finish simple functions and discuss ideas. I also very much like how LLMs are able to explain code and concepts.
P2,tom-first,False,M,6.0,7,5.0,6,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,No not really,"When I used to program alot, LLMs weren't such a big thing yet. During my masters I dont really program that much anymore."
P3,control-first,True,M,4.5,7,2.0,7,4,1,4,5,4,4,4,5,No,I value the explanations about concepts or challenges I would not be able to encounter by myself. I like the support it gives me.
P4,control-first,True,M,8.0,8,8.0,6,6,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,,"It can give me pointers to terms and explanations of things that are hard to search on google (such as a bare latex formula). But the results are still hit-or-miss, it can sometimes give very weird/wrong answers. Because of that, I find it hard to trust the output in general."
P5,control-first,True,B2,6.0,5,7.0,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,"To clarify the ""Writing new code"" bit, I myself didn't, but a partner of mine used Chatgpt for code in a shared project.","For some reason, I'm not use to it. Similar to how older generations might prefer mail over the Internet, I prefer to use Google/Firefox over LLMs."
P6,tom-first,True,B3,6.5,7,6.0,4,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,,I think they are capable at doing simple or menial tasks. Otherwise I believe that you have to put more time into describing the program to them than you would if you just solved the problem yourself with optional help of StackOverflow.

P8,tom-first,True,M,4.5,7,2.0,7,7,1,3,2,3,4,3,2,Sometimes I use chatGPT to improve the grammar and flow of texts.,Quite useful to debug code but does not always work properly.
P9,tom-first,False,B2,2.5,3,2.0,5,2,1,3,2,1,1,2,2,No,It can be helpful when I'm not familiar with functions that can trivialize a programming problem
P10,control-first,False,B3,5.0,8,2.0,9,8,1,4,3,1,1,2,1,,a proper explanation about how the code is constructed
P11,tom-first,True,B3,6.5,7,6.0,8,7,6,3,2,2,2,3,3,No,"In general LLMs can be sued for writing code, however when there are more specific tasks involved it can be harder for a LLM to write the correct code."

P13,control-first,False,M,3.0,5,1.0,5,2,1,3,2,2,3,3,3,"I sometimes use ChatGPT to help me with writing motivation letters for job applications, explaining study-related concepts (specifically in physics and mathematics but also programming related), and ask for movie recommendations. ","As I am still at a relatively basic level in programming, LLMs, so far, have been able to help me understand programming-related concepts better and have also been able to help me understand why my code doesn't work sometimes. I like the fact that LLMs are able to give you a very detailed but understandable overview of complex topics and also offer suggestions in an intuitive way. "
P14,tom-first,False,B3,2.0,2,2.0,2,3,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,,It gives help and setup for Code you want to write
