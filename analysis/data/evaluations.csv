Although it seemed better to fit the length of the answer to the question, I still would like an option for more information. For example, this response could have been ""Yes it returns a string with the current working directory"" But the answer the chatbot gave was: ""Yes, that's correct! In the code snippet provided, os.getcwd() is used to get the current working directory (cwd) path. This function returns a string representing the current working directory where the Python script is being executed."". Although this is context dependent.",ejthue,3.0,"Maybe there was a slight difference, but it was not big enough for me to be affected by it.

I did not really like the encouragement ""feel free to ask"", as this was repetatively done. In the end it was kind of annoying. The chatbot sometimes provided more general information than the other chatbot about the functioning of code. I more liked the practical knowledge of chatbot A in this case.",a2vium,2.0,"No, it did not matter to me."
P4,A,5,5,6,6,7,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,5.0,-10.0,-8.0,8.0,3.0,-7.0,"I could ask it pretty complex questions that requires understanding of the entire code (what effect does the TF-TDF score have on the final output in `comparisons`? and what can this code be used for?) and it was able to give an answer that was applicable to the code.
It does tend to give quite long answers though. For the question about the effect of the TF-IDF score, it gave a bit too much background information for me, so it takes unnecessarily long to read.",i2wsfv,,

It seems to give quite general answers that do not necessarily directly relate to this program, even when asked to be more specific to this program (it just repeated its previous answer just worded slightly differently). It also added fluff at the end of its last answers (""if you have more questions, feel free to ask""), which is useless.
It was able to explain how the plot would end up looking, which is nice, though it was not very to the point.",i2wsfv,2.0,"Not much, but I noticed for chatbot B that I continued looking through the code for a bit after I had asked a question, instead of waiting for it to answer."

I disliked (but only slightly) that some of the answers Chatbot A gave were longer than I feel like they needed to be, but it might be useful for someone else to have detailed answers.",4r7uba,,

This did result in me having to ask for clarification 2-3 times, but this was not necessarily annoying. The answers Chatbot B gave me usually explained enough to understand what I wanted to understand. I think I asked a few more questions in this task than the previous because I was less familiar with the methods used, not because Chatbot B gave worse answers.",4r7uba,4.0,"The first response from Chatbot A took a longer time than I expected. This made me think for a few seconds that it was broken. Chatbot B sometimes surprised me by how quickly it responded, which I found interesting.
I think otherwise the difference in response time did not cause frustration with either bot. They are both pretty quick, and as long as the answers don't take as long as that first answer in Chatbot A (I think 5 seconds???) I would mostly look at the type of answers they give."
